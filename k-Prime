/*A natural number is called k-prime if it has exactly k prime factors, counted with multiplicity. A natural number is thus prime if 
and only if it is 1-prime.

Given an integer k and a list arr of positive integers the function consec_kprimes (or its variants in other languages) returns how 
many times in the sequence arr numbers come up twice in a row with exactly k prime factors?*/
